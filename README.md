# Uncertainity-Repo
# LISA
GitHub repository for Xojo model version control, documentation hosting, and project management.

Page numbers and quoted passages relate to the NSF grant pertaining to this project.

# Onboarding

## Version Control
### Git Branching Strategy
We follow typical Git practices. Each feature should be completed on a separate branch. Commits should ideally be small, focused, and worded in the imperative tense. See for inspiration: https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/

### git clone
git clone using GH account password is now deprecated, it is reccomended that collaborators generate a 90-day CLASSIC Personal Access Token adn save it in a save place on their local machine for the purposes of authentication for pushing and pulling to the remote repo.

## Documentation
Documentation will be via Jamdocs. 
Example of a Jamdocs Documentation website: : https://jamdocs.samuelhorn.com/

### Philosophy and Justification
"For people to use the software effectively, it must be documented thoroughly. Space limitations
mean that few published papers provide enough information for someone to actually use a model
even if it were to be available. One goal of this part of the project would to be to create online
resources that would allow a user to deeply understand the both physics behind the model (with
an appreciation of its strengths and weaknesses) and how the user interface works." (pD-10)

## Task + Project Management
Project management is via Github projects. TODOs are listed here in a User Story Format along with optional story points.

# Project Roadmap
## High-Performance Computing (HPC) 
"Being able to compile to Linux opens up possibilities for running the model on high-performance
computing (HPC) systems such as Pomonaâ€™s brand-new HPC resources, something the PI intends
to explore." (pD-11)
